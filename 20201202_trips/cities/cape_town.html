    <!-- Brief description of the city -->
    <p>
        Wikipedia: <br><br>
        "Cape Town is the second-most populous city in South Africa, after 
        Johannesburg, and also the legislative capital of South Africa. 
        Colloquially named the Mother City, it is the largest city of the 
        Western Cape province and forms part of the City of Cape Town 
        metropolitan municipality. The Parliament of South Africa is situated in
        Cape Town. The other two capitals are located in Gauteng (Pretoria the 
        executive capital where the Presidency is based) and in the Free State 
        (Bloemfontein the judicial capital where the Supreme Court of Appeal is 
        located). The city is known for its harbour, for its natural setting in 
        the Cape Floristic Region, and for landmarks such as Table Mountain and 
        Cape Point. Cape Town is home to 64% of the Western Cape's population. 
        The city was named the World Design Capital for 2014 by the 
        International Council of Societies of Industrial Design."
