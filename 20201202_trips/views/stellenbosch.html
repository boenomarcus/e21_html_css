                                situated about 50 kilometres (31 miles) east of Cape Town, along the 
                                banks of the Eerste River at the foot of the Stellenbosch Mountain. It 
                                is the second oldest European settlement in the province, after Cape 
                                Town. The town became known as the City of Oaks or Eikestad in Afrikaans 
                                and Dutch due to the large number of oak trees that were planted by its 
                                founder, Simon van der Stel, to grace the streets and homesteads."
